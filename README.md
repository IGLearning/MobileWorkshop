**The Challenge**

It’s your first day on the job as a graduate mobile developer, and the CEO has already come to you with a crisis. Last week, a new trading app launched, but the job was rushed and it shipped with a few bugs. It’s your job to fix them! 

Here are the bugs (in order of difficulty):

**BUG (Level 1):** 
Someone broke the buy button. Every time you tap ‘buy’ on a market, it breaks. It’s your job to search through the app and fix it!

**BUG (Level 2):**
Fixed the buy button, great! The app should be able to buy and sell markets, but on the ‘Me’ page, you’ll notice the ‘balance’ and ‘running profit and loss’ values aren’t updating properly! Find out where the profile card should be updated, and make sure the correct values are streaming as they should.

**BUG (Level 3):**
This is a challenging one! On the ‘Open Positions’ page you’ll notice that instead of a name, the card shows the ID of the market. This should use the name of the market instead. For some hints and tips check out the `AppStorage` class, and how it’s used.

###**Stretch Challenge**
On the ‘Me’ page you’ll notice there’s a “Button that does nothing”. Your challenge is to make it do something. Prize for the most creative solution.
